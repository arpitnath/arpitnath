👋 I’m Arpit Nath  

🛠 Engineer by instinct, generalist by choice — from TCP/IP internals to distributed DBs to front-end rendering cycles  

⚡️ Known for shipping fast, thinking deep, and switching context without missing precision  

🧠 Systems should feel like flow: fast, focused, frictionless  

☕ Caffeine powers the code. Craftsmanship powers the outcome.  

🎸 When I’m not building, I’m either behind the wheel or lost in a Green Day loop  


🤫 **Fun fact:** I’ve debugged critical prod issues faster than most people find the file
